# Solitaire
Simple solitaire implementation to try [pararules](https://github.com/paranim/pararules).  
The user interface is ugly since I just needed something to test with

Use `nimble run` to install all dependencies and run it  


## How to use:
To cycle through the stock write "s"  
To use a card from the talon, write "t"  
To use a card from the tableau, write the number of the column it's in  
If there's more than 1 visible card in the column, you will be prompted to select which card to use

After selecting a card, you will be prompted with a list of valid moves, enter a number to choose one of them.
You can at any point write "c" to cancel your current selections.

## How to play
I based it of [this](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/solitaire/) and the game that pops up when you google "Solitaire"  
Not implemented: quickly adding cards to the foundation, taking cards away from the foundation
